      <strong data-v-489297cd="">SECURITY</strong>
      <p data-v-489297cd="">
        All User passwords are encrypted. When You create an account or update
        Your password, the password is immediately encrypted before being stored
        in Our database. Encryption is a process that converts plain-text data
        (the user's password) into an unreadable format using a cryptographic
        key. This ensures that even if unauthorized individuals gain access to
        the database, they will not be able to decipher the passwords without
        the corresponding decryption key.
      </p>
      <p data-v-489297cd="">
        We also implement measures to protect the encryption keys, limiting
        access to authorized personnel only. This adds an extra layer of
        security to prevent potential data breaches. By employing encryption
        techniques, we prioritize the confidentiality and integrity of Your
        passwords, making it significantly more challenging for malicious actors
        to exploit any potential security vulnerabilities and compromise the
        security of Your account. Our commitment to data security is steadfast,
        and We continuously review and improve Our practices to stay up-to-date
        with the latest security standards.
      </p>

        We also use the following security measures to protect Your information:
      </p>
      <p data-v-489297cd="">
        a) Password Protection: Using password encryption in order to safe
        access by authorized individuals;

        b) Secure Development Practices: Following secure coding practices

      <p data-v-489297cd="">
